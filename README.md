# Compendium_OpenSource
Blender add-on written with Python and Serpens.

This add-on is taylored to my personal Blender workflow, but it has some interesting tools and layouts that might be of use to others who work similarly.

## Changes using the Blender file
If you have the [Serpens 3](https://blendermarket.com/products/serpens?search_id=33250934) addon for Blender, you can you the [.blend file](https://github.com/jbikeler/Compendium_OpenSource/blob/main/current_release/Compendium3_4.2_101124.blend) in the [current_release folder](https://github.com/jbikeler/Compendium_OpenSource/tree/main/current_release) to edit the addon or see how it was made.

## History Post Version 3.8.0
For and versions after 3.8.0, feel free to check the commit log of the [current_release folder](https://github.com/jbikeler/Compendium_OpenSource/tree/main/current_release). Files for these addons are technically not updated but duplicated and built upon. In the future I might create and master __init.py__ file that will track the exact changes in code that have changed from version to version.

## Support
Since this add-on is written to be a personal Blender workflow, I will most likely not be able to support community pull requests and recommended features. I am constantly tweaking this add on to better fit my workflow as I learn more about 3D modeling techniques so occasionally I will be removing or adjusting features that users might have enjoyed. This is why I will be including the working files and the commit history so that you can always roll back to a previous version and see how it was made. Feel free to adjust the add-on or implement features in your own personal Compendium project!

# Enjoy! Hope it serves you well!
