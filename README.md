# Compendium_OpenSource
Blender addon written with Python and Serpens.

This addon is my taylored workflow in Blender but it might be of use to others who work similarly.

## Changes using the Blender file
If you have the [Serpens 3](https://blendermarket.com/products/serpens?search_id=33250934) addon for Blender, you can you the .blend file in the current_release folder to edit the addon or see how it was made.

## History Post Version 3.8.0
For and versions after 3.8.0, feel free to check the commit log of the current_release folder. Files for these addons are technically not updated but duplicated and built upon. In the future I might create and master __init.py__ file that will track the exact changes in code that have changed from version to version.
